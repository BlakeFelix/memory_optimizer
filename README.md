# Memory Optimizer

This project provides a lightweight implementation of a dynamic context
optimization system for language models.  It includes in-memory storage of
"memories", scoring for relevance, and context assembly within a token budget.

The code in `aimemory/` is intentionally minimal but mirrors the architecture
outlined in the project description.
